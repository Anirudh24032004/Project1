        MongoDB is a popular NoSQL document database known for its flexibility,
        scalability, and ease of use. It stores data in a format similar to
        JSON, called BSON, enabling efficient data storage and retrieval. Unlike
        relational databases, MongoDB uses a flexible schema, allowing for
        dynamic data structures and easy adaptation to changing application
        requirements.
