        JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily used to create
        interactive and dynamic content for websites. It's a lightweight,
        cross-platform language that executes code line by line, offering
        flexibility in how websites are designed and updated. Beyond web
        development, JavaScript is also used for server-side applications, CLI
        tools, and even in AI development.
