        Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment
        that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It is built on
        Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, allowing for fast and efficient
        execution of code. Node.js is primarily used for server-side
        programming, enabling developers to use JavaScript for both front-end
        and back-end development. It is well-suited for building scalable
        network applications, real-time applications, and APIs.
