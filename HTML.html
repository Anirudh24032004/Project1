        HTML, short for HyperText Markup Language, is the foundation for
        structuring content on the web. It defines the content and structure of
        web pages, telling browsers how to display text, images, links, and
        other media. While CSS handles styling and JavaScript adds
        interactivity, HTML provides the basic framework for web pages. Here's a
        more detailed look: Key aspects of HTML: Markup Language: HTML is a
        markup language, meaning it uses tags and attributes to annotate text
        and other content, instructing browsers how to display it. Structure:
        HTML defines the structure of a web page, organizing content into
        headings, paragraphs, lists, and other elements. Content: HTML handles
        the content of a webpage, including text, images, videos, and
        interactive elements. Tags: HTML elements are defined by tags, which are
        enclosed in angle brackets Attributes: Attributes provide additional
        information about HTML elements, such as specifying the source of an
        image or the target of a link. Interactivity: While HTML itself doesn't
        provide interactivity, it is often combined with CSS for styling and
        JavaScript for adding interactive features
