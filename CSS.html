        CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language
        used to style and enhance the presentation of web pages. It's one of the
        three core technologies of the web, along with HTML and JavaScript. CSS
        describes how HTML elements should be displayed, influencing their
        appearance on screen, paper, or other media.
