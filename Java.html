        Java is a versatile, object-oriented programming language used for a
        wide range of applications, from web and mobile development to
        enterprise software and big data processing. It's known for its platform
        independence, meaning code can run on any device that supports the Java
        Virtual Machine (JVM). Java's robustness, memory management, and
        extensive ecosystem of developers and libraries make it a popular choice
        for developers worldwide.
